## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 

I wrote the code using Atom editor.


### What I learned

Just getting started here with html and css. Just figuring out how to create the background shape, and add and center the image and text inside was quite challenging!


### Continued development

The next module in the class I'm slowly taking is on Bootstrap, but I am going to try my hand at more of these html/css challenges before moving on. I still don't really understand concepts such as absolute vs relative positioning, and when things need to be displayed inline vs. block. 

### Useful resources

- I found myself at https://www.w3schools.com/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ frequently to try and resolve issues I was having. I find the W3 Schools "try it" editor really helpful for understanding and tinkering with concepts.
